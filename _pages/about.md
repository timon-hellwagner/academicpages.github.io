Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D student in the department "Forecasts and Macroeconomic Analyses" at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg, Germany.

In my research, I analyze demographic processes and their labor market effects on different spatial levels, with a focus on the effects of population decline.
